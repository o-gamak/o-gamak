<summary><b>🔬 Current Projects </b></summary>

1. **[1_1_research_data_analysis](https://github.com/o-gamak/1_1_research_data_analysis)**  
   *Exploratory Data Analysis of real estate listings in Saint Petersburg for Yandex Realty.*  
   Analyzed factors affecting apartment prices (area, distance to center, number of rooms) and identified 5% anomalies potentially indicating fraud. Used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize price distributions and correlation heatmaps.

2. **[1_2_capstone_project_1](https://github.com/o-gamak/1_2_capstone_project_1)**  
   *Russian film market analysis for the Ministry of Culture.*  
   Combined 100K+ records of film distribution permits and Kinopoisk ratings. Found that state‑supported films (10% of market) earn 50% less than commercial ones. Visualized box office trends and seasonal patterns.

3. **[2_1_statistical_data_analysis](https://github.com/o-gamak/2_1_statistical_data_analysis)**  
   *User behavior analysis for GoFast scooter‑sharing service.*  
   Tested hypotheses about subscription (ultra) vs. free users. Confirmed ultra users generate 15% more revenue (p‑value < 0.05). Recommended 1,172 promo codes to reduce risk to 5%.

4. **[2_2_linear_ml_problems](https://github.com/o-gamak/2_2_linear_ml_problems)**  
   *Milk yield prediction for "Volny Lug" farm.*  
   Built regression models to predict annual milk yield (≥6,000 kg) and flavor probability. Achieved R² = 0.79 (RMSE = 500 kg) for yield and Precision = 1.0 at 0.8 threshold for flavor.

5. **[2_3_supervised_learning](https://github.com/o-gamak/2_3_supervised_learning)**  
   *Customer segmentation for "In One Click" online store.*  
   Developed a classification model (85% accuracy, F1 = 0.82) to identify 10% of customers at risk of reduced activity. Created 3 segments and visualized purchase patterns.

6. **[2_4_capstone_project_2](https://github.com/o-gamak/2_4_capstone_project_2)**  
   *Employee satisfaction and churn prediction for "Work with Care".*  
   Built models to predict churn (80% accuracy, ROC‑AUC = 0.85) and satisfaction (R² = 0.7). Recommended training programs for employees with scores < 0.5 to reduce churn by 10–15%.

7. **[3_1_ml_in_business](https://github.com/o-gamak/3_1_ml_in_business)**  
   *Oil well location optimization for "GlavRosGosNeft".*  
   Analyzed 3 regions using bootstrap (1,000 samples). Selected Region 2 with zero loss risk and projected profit of 518 M RUB (budget: 10 B RUB). Model RMSE < 41K barrels.

8. **[3_2_basic_sql](https://github.com/o-gamak/3_2_basic_sql)** — SQL fundamentals practice repository

9. **[3_3_big_data_processing_system](https://github.com/o-gamak/3_3_big_data_processing_system)**  
   *California housing price prediction using PySpark.*  
   Built a distributed linear regression pipeline (Spark SQL + MLlib) on 1990 data. Achieved RMSE = 68,421 (target ≤ 70,000), MAE = 49,875, R² = 0.651. Key features: median_income and ocean proximity.

10. **[4_1_numerical_methods](https://github.com/o-gamak/4_1_numerical_methods)**  
   *"Not Dented, Not Painted" car valuation model.*  
   Compared 4 models (RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) for used car pricing. CatBoost won with RMSE = 1,540.8 (1.6× better than requirement) and 0.4 sec prediction time. Top features: year, power, mileage.

11. **[4_2_workshop](https://github.com/o-gamak/4_2_workshop)**  
    *90‑day purchase prediction for an online clothing store.*  
    Built a CatBoost classifier (ROC‑AUC = 0.8275) using 40+ features (RFM metrics, CTR, recency). SHAP analysis identified ctr_30d as the top driver. Project includes automatic data loading and requirements.txt.

12. **[school21_intensive](https://github.com/o-gamak/school21_intensive)**  

*26‑day intensive programming bootcamp at Sber’s School 21.*
Learned Bash and C from scratch: started with basic syntax and progressed to dynamic memory allocation, matrices, and pointer arithmetic. Completed two group projects applying core programming concepts. Covered shell scripting, memory management, and algorithmic problem‑solving in a high‑intensity, immersive environment.
